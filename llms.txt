# TEMPT Token ($TMPT)

> TEMPT Token ($TMPT) is a Solana-based utility cryptocurrency built for adult content creator micropayments. It eliminates chargeback fraud and reduces transaction fees from 5–15% (credit cards) to 0.1%–0.5%, with sub-second settlement and no banking restrictions.

## What is $TMPT?

TEMPT Token is a purpose-built payment token for the adult content industry launching on Solana in Q1 2026. It enables cam sites, OnlyFans-alternative platforms, AI companion apps, and independent creators to accept instant, anonymous micropayments globally.

**Key facts:**
- Ticker: $TMPT
- Blockchain: Solana (SPL token)
- Total supply: 1,000,000,000 TMPT
- Transaction fee: 0.1%–0.5% (vs. 5–15% on credit cards)
- Chargebacks: Zero (blockchain-final transactions)
- Settlement: Under 1 second
- Launch: Q1 2026

## The Problem We Solve

Adult content creators and platforms face three critical payment problems:
1. **High fees** — Credit card processors charge 5–15% per transaction. A creator earning $10,000/month loses up to $1,500/month in fees alone.
2. **Chargeback fraud** — 5–10% chargeback rates on adult content cost the industry billions annually. Blockchain transactions are irreversible.
3. **Deplatforming** — Stripe, PayPal, and mainstream processors regularly ban adult businesses with no notice. $TMPT has no central authority that can revoke access.
4. **Geographic exclusion** — 2.4+ billion people worldwide lack credit cards or are in countries where adult transactions are blocked. Crypto reaches everyone.
